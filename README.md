# stickman-animation
This is  the small stick man animation that is carried out using the C programming language. It is created using the <graphics.h> header file. 
* The program uses the various function available in C Graphics library to create a awesome stick man animation . 
* It is created for fun and please don't take the animation seriously. 
* The viewers can copy and run the code to see the actual outcome of the program. It is still in the phase of development. There might be several short commings in the design and the coding.
* So feedback much more appreciated. 
# happy coding everyone !!
